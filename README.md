# \# 🛡️ ZeroDay Radar

# 

# AI-powered security intelligence platform for startups

# 

# \## Problem

# Startups waste 72+ hours during security incidents trying to figure out which vulnerabilities actually matter. Enterprise tools are too expensive and complex.

# 

# \## Solution

# ZeroDay Radar provides AI-driven security intelligence specifically designed for startups:

# 

# \### Modules

# 

# \#### ✅ VulnPath (Active)

# \- Maps attack paths through your infrastructure

# \- Shows which CVEs can actually reach critical assets

# \- Prioritizes patches based on real risk, not just CVSS scores

# 

# \#### 🚧 VulnPredict (In Development)

# \- Early warning system for zero-day vulnerabilities

# \- Monitors GitHub, Stack Overflow, Reddit for anomalies

# \- Predicts which libraries might have undiscovered vulnerabilities

# 

# \#### 📋 SecureRank (Planned)

# \- Benchmark security posture against similar companies

# \- Board-ready security metrics

# 

# \#### 📋 PatchSafe (Planned)

# \- ML-powered patch impact prediction

# \- Tells you which patches are safe to deploy

#
